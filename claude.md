## Workflow

1. first, think through the problem. read the codebase and write a plan in tasks/todo.md
2. the plan should be checklist of todo items.
3. check in with me before starting work, i will verify the plan.
4. then, complete the todos one by one, marking them off as you go.
5. at every steop, give me a high-level explanation of what you changed.
6. keep every change simple and minimal. avoid big rewrites.
7. at the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing the changes.
8. go through the code you just wrote and confirm it follows security best practices. check that no sensitive date is left in the frontend, and that there are no vulnerabilities an attacker could exploit.
9. please explain the functionality and code you just built in detail. walk me through what you changed and how it works. act like you are a senior engineer teaching me.
